# Emotion Detection Using Transfer Learning 

In this project I developed an Emotion Detection Image Classification using a simple CNN architecture and compared its performance with transfer learning models like VGG16 and ResNet50.

Dataset i took it from kaggle. The quality of data was not up to the mark , there were some misclassfied photos so it has actually hindered performance of models.



## Screenshots

- Simple cnn architecture designed manually, we can clearly see there are too too many mis classifications

- Simple cnn architecture which uses data augmentation

- ResNet50, which performed best till now on my dataset.
